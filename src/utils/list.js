    "description": "<h3>ABOUT THE ROLE</h3>\n<p>FLOWN is an early-stage tech startup and this role offers the opportunity to start right at the beginning of building a new tech stack. You'll be contributing to the design and development of the product, and steering the direction we take in the future.</p>\n<p>Over the next few months we'll be building: our marketing website, a property catalogue, a booking engine and payments solution, a content portal along with games and tools to support our members in embracing deep work principles.</p>\n<p>We then have ambitious plans for the future once we're finished with those!</p>\n<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>\n<p>Ideally we're looking for someone who has the following attributes/experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarity with at least some of our core tech stack eg. Google Firebase, NoSQL databases (Firestore or MongoDB), Serverless technologies (Firebase Functions or AWS Lambda), NodeJS, Typescript, React.</li>\n<li>Designing and developing server-side applications that expose APIs.</li>\n<li>Knowledge of tools and techniques in back-end application development (even if you haven't used all of them) e.g. data modelling, process flows, APIs, messaging systems, authentication etc.</li>\n<li>Working with SQL or NoSQL databases.</li>\n<li>Integrating SaaS products using their APIs.</li>\n<li>Writing automated tests and/or comfortable creating testing strategies and processes.</li>\n<li>Frontend development in JavaScript, HTML and CSS - or a willingness to learn.</li>\n<li>Comfortable taking on a project, proposing a technical design, building it, and deploying the result. We don't expect you to know everything, as we'll support you, but we're looking for that level of desire.</li>\n<li>Working on personal projects or open source contributions - we love to see developers' side projects - even if they're not related to what we're building.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>BENEFITS</h3>\n<p>We want to practice what we preach, and build a company and team that works creatively and productively. Here are some of the benefits you'll gain from this role:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scope and influence - you're joining the founding team, where our developers are integrated into the business. You'll participate in the early analysis and design process, understand the business problems we're trying to solve, and get the chance to propose ingenious designs that minimise the amount of work we have to do.</li>\n<li>A focus on deep work - we exist to support deep work among our members, so we support our staff in developing their own distraction-free deep work practice.</li>\n<li>A strong team - you'll work closely with a proven CEO &amp; Founder, and a highly experienced team. We have a high-calibre of investors with a good amount of runway.</li>\n<li>Work/life balance - our standard full-time week is 32 hours, and (within reason) you can decide how to structure those hours across the week.</li>\n<li>Fully dispersed - we are a remote-first company, and we've got lots of perks, tools and processes to make sure that works for everyone. We also allocate budgets to ensure that you can work comfortably and/or get together with other team members when you need to.</li>\n<li>Team offsites and regular fun - we get together each quarter (ideally somewhere sunny) to collaborate and have fun. We also embed virtual activities and other surprises into our working days.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ABOUT FLOWN</h3>\n<p>Even before COVID, working in open-plan offices full of distractions was not the best environment for producing our best work. Studies show that our best productivity and creativity comes when you get a chance to do 'deep work' - uninterrupted focused time working on something significant. Post-COVID, the need for places to work ergonomically away from your office - either as an individual or as a team - is even greater. FLOWN is the first global brand seeking to provide the ideal physical and mental spaces for us to think and work more creatively and productively.</p>\n<p>FLOWN will offer a marketplace of spaces suitable for individuals or teams to get away from their day-to-day to concentrate, contemplate or collaborate. We'll offer not only physical spaces - think Airbnb for Work - but mental spaces through our app and online services. Available to individuals and companies as a subscription, to be offered as an accompaniment or replacement to traditional office rental.</p>\n<p>FLOWN is led by successful serial entrepreneur, Alicia Navarro, founder of Skimlinks (acquired by Connexity April 2020), and backed well-known entrepreneurs and angels such as Greg Marsh (OneFineStay), Taavet Hinrikus (Transferwise), Tom Allason (Shutl). FLOWN is seeking to create social impact by democratisating access to the kind of spaces that can best unleash our human potential, so we can not only solve real global problems but also live more meaningful lives.</p>\n",

    "title": "Area Architect Digital Platform Authorization",
    "description": "<h2>Imagine…</h2>\n<p>You work on a banking product being used by seven million customers at Rabobank, one of the largest IT employers in the Netherlands. As an area architect, you will be helping to build microservices and web applications that make digital banking possible worldwide.</p>\n<h2>Create an impact</h2>\n<p>Within the Distribution department you will work together with more than 50 DevOps teams to develop and manage the online channels of Rabobank. Examples of our success are the Rabobank Banking App, the rabobank.nl and rabobank.com websites, corporate banking, onboarding for online secure clients and digital identification.</p>\n<p>Rabobank’s digital platform is based on modern web technology. Rabobank’s mobile platform incorporates this web-based platform and extends it by providing native apps for iOS and Android with additional security measures, and by integrating tightly with the mobile platforms the apps run on.</p>\n<p>Within the tribe Digital Platform, we are organized in areas. Each area has a number of squads that work on a common purpose, like the public sites, the app and site for consumers &amp; freelancers, and secure authentication of users.</p>\n<p>As an area architect, you will contribute to the digital transformation of the bank within such an area and will be the driving force behind developments, such as Open Banking. All development is done within the cloud using the latest cutting-edge technology.</p>\n<p>In the area Authorization we provide authorization services on our user, customer and product administration to all other IT departments in the bank. For business users we provide the means to configure their own authorization schemes for their organization. We are planning to migrate our current architecture to a completely new, modern, state of the art authorization architecture. You can be a part in designing and realizing this architecture! You will be leading and coaching the architecture team!</p>\n<p>In order to achieve this, we expect that you have at least five years of experience with customer-facing web applications in enterprise environments. You know how to build systems that are easy to operate and maintain and that can last a long time while undergoing changes continuously. You are a communicative team player, and have a drive to improve yourself and the people around you. You are a sparring partner for both business and IT and are able to express yourself clearly depending on your audience.</p>\n<h2>With each other</h2>\n<p>Working together as a team within Distribution is a highly important part within your working day. As an architect you will be working closely with multiple international DevOps teams. You guide the teams towards the best results in a future-proof architecture.</p>\n<p>Within Distribution everyone keeps each other on their toes and helps each other where possible. We expect the same from you. This also applies to experimenting in the use of the latest techniques and technologies.</p>\n<p>You need to have the courage to challenge and develop yourself even when you and your team make a mistake. The important part is that you (and your team) learn from that and grow.</p>\n<h2>With your talents</h2>\n<p>For this position it is logical that you need to understand our growing customer needs. You can achieve this by having an unstoppable hunger and drive to work with the latest techniques and cutting-edge technologies. In addition, it’s important that you will recognize yourself in the following checklist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have at minimum a completed (technical) bachelor degree</li>\n<li>You have extensive experience with working in large organizations on complex technological landscapes</li>\n<li>You have demonstrable knowledge of authorization systems and relevant architectures</li>\n<li>You have experience with the full lifecycle of software, from idea to retirement, using modern techniques like microservices and fully automated pipelines.</li>\n<li>You have experience with modern web technologies (Angular, Ionic), back-end technologies (microservices, Java) and cloud (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure)</li>\n<li>You are familiar with the rituals of Agile / Scrum</li>\n<li>You have an opinion and an open view on the future</li>\n<li>You embrace changes and self-leadership is in your DNA!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Let’s meet.</h2>\n<p>Are you the person we’re looking for?</p>\n<p>Are you our new colleague who will strengthen Rabobank as an area architect for our digital platform and thus make the difference for yourself, our customers and society?</p>\n<p>If you are, we are happy to receive your application including your motivation via <a href=\"https://vonq.io/2T7KQLd\">this link!</a></p>\n<h2>Good to know:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Lois Hageman, senior recruiter, would be happy to answer any questions about the application procedure via <a href=\"mailto:marie-louise.hageman@rabobank.nl\">marie-louise.hageman@rabobank.nl</a>\n</li>\n<li>The application process includes screening. Based on the screening procedures in place at Rabobank, we assess whether new staff are reliable enough to work at Rabobank.</li>\n<li>Everyone is different, and it is exactly those differences that help us become an even better bank. That's why we want to know who you really are!</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description": "<p>Our Mission: Our mission is to accelerate hardware creation by making tools that increase the speed and performance of engineering and manufacturing processes for mechanical engineers, roboticists, product designers, and beyond.</p>\n<p>Our Company: We are a newly funded (Dec 2019), seed stage, pre-product-market fit company, and though we’re very early, we bring with us the experience and customers from building previous companies in this exact space. We’re led by seasoned entrepreneurs, bringing 100s of personal big client relationships in our industry with us, and have many years of runway ahead of us with money in the bank from some of the top VCs and angels in Silicon Valley. Many of our team members previously worked together at a startup, which has proven helpful in creating a trusted core team from the start. We’ve also conducted thorough customer research interviews, as well as industry / vendor research, etc. to confirm our hypotheses and strategy have a high probability of success.</p>\n<p>We’re currently in stealth mode, so we’re not talking about our product or strategy publicly, so please reach out to us, and we’ll tell you all about it. Here is a public video and talk deck that will give you a taste of our broad vision for remaking how humanity designs and manufactures physical products. We know this is a teaser, but trust us, it’s worth it :-)</p>\n<p>About the Role: We’re looking for a Senior Engineer to join our engineering team. You will report to the CTO and will push our development initiatives forward to build our MVP product and iterate to product-market fit by QE2 2021. To do so, you’ll work alongside the founding team to create the strategy and plan, and you’ll help mentor a team of engineers and outsourced development teams - helping build both our customer UX and core scalable data processing technology. This position offers potential opportunities to expand into leadership as the company grows.</p>\n<p>Tech Stack: We use modern technologies to leapfrog others in our industry burdened by legacy stacks. We embrace the cloud, including containers and event-driven serverless architecture where it makes sense. Our web apps are built with node, typescript, vue, nuxt, and connect to backend systems that use GraphQL, Postgres, and Elasticsearch.</p>\n<p>Our Founders: Volition was founded by Nick Pinkston (CEO) and Jeremy Herrman (CTO) who are veteran startup founders who previously co-founded Plethora together in 2013 where they built a new kind of highly flexible automated factory to speed up the prototyping and production process for some of the top hardware companies and products in the world. They grew the business to 80+ employees and millions in annual revenue before they left to start Volition, an even more ambitious and scalable project.</p>\n<p>Our Team and Culture: We’re currently a small team of seven working remotely and plan to resume working together in our office in San Francisco once all is safe. We’re committed to building a strong culture that values developing the whole person: mind, body, and spirit, and we are in the process of integrating professional and personal development systems into our core company cadences. We’re committed to continually improving our hiring processes and policies to deliberately build the best team by drawing from many diverse backgrounds and perspectives.</p>\n<p>Our Compensation: We offer competitive salaries, significant stock options, good healthcare, and other benefits in-line with companies of similar size.</p>\n<p>Our Risk Management: The world is crazy now with Covid-19, and we hope you, family, and friends are staying healthy. We want you to know that we’re well prepared for any crisis as we have raised enough capital to have several years of runway including new hires and other needs of our plan. Our target market is also highly stable, so we don’t anticipate much go-to-market risk even in the case of a prolonged recession.</p>\n<p>We are committed to being an Equal Opportunity Employer.</p>\n",
